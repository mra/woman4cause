**Computational modelling of insulin response to glucose uptake including the role of obesity**

1.	Hypothesis

Insulin response to glucose intake is modified by obesity.

2.	Background

On observing the OGTT data or glucose feeding pattern of obese and non-obese patients the
insulin responses were found to be different. The patients were given glucose solution (75g of
glucose in 200mL of water) and their blood samples were collected over 2 hours. Every 15 minutes
starting from 0 (before giving glucose solution), 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 various parameters were
observed. A model will be developed to study the effect of obesity in insulin glucose pathway.
There are theoretical reports that supports the association of insulin with adipokines(adiponectin,
leptin and adipsin) whereas the biological significance of the association of glucose and adipokines
are yet to be found. For now adipokines are expected to modulate IG pathway where glucose will
be an independent variable and insulin will be a dependent variable. The insulin release depends
on mainly four factors:

*	Glucose level

*	Insulin resistance

*	β-cell function

*	GLP-1 level

GLP-1 (Glucagon like peptide) is an incretin that stimulates β-cells of pancreas to produce
insulin in a glucose dependent fashion. When glucose goes up insulin is secreted and when
glucose level lowers insulin secretion is shut off. GLP-1 is secreted by epithelial cells in the gut in
accordance with the glucose levels in the meals. The DPP-4 enzyme decrease insulin secretion by
converting active GLP-1 to inactive GLP-1. DPP-4 inhibitors enhance peripheral glucose uptake
and suppresses glucagon secretion thereby reducing hepatic glucose output leading to better glycemic control. DPP-4 inhibitors increase insulin secretion depending upon intake of food.
More food intake, more of GLP-1 more insulin secretion whereas less food intake less glycemic
control. It also improves health status of β-cells by protecting them from further damage.

3.	Factors that influence the association of insulin response
and obesity
Obesity can be expressed in different ways:

3.1	BMI

BMI (Body Mass Index) is the most common marker of obesity. BMI is a person’s weight in
kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. BMI is an inexpensive and easy screening
method with standardized cutoff points for overweight and obesity: Normal weight is a BMI
between 18.5 and 24.9; overweight is a BMI between 25.0 and 29.9; obesity is a BMI of 30.0 or
higher. BMI does not measure body fat directly, but BMI is moderately correlated with more
direct measures of body fat. It is an indirect and imperfect measurement and does not distinguish
between body fat and lean body mass.

3.2 Waist Circumference

The addition of waist circumference (WC) to body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) predicts a greater
variance in health risk than does BMI alone https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/79.3.379. Excessive
abdominal fat may be serious because it places you at greater risk for developing obesity-related
conditions, such as Type 2 Diabetes, high blood pressure, and coronary artery disease. The
waistline may suggest a higher risk of developing obesity-related conditions for: a man whose
waist circumference is more than 40 inches and a non-pregnant woman whose waist circumference
is more than 35 inches.
Waist circumference can be used as a screening tool but is not diagnostic of the body fatness
or health of an individual. May be less accurate as the measurement procedure has not been
standardized

3.3 Bioelectric Impedance (BIA) for fat mass

BIA equipment sends a small, imperceptible, safe electric current through the body, measuring
the resistance. The current faces more resistance passing through body fat than it does passing
through lean body mass and water. Equations are used to estimate body fat percentage and
fat-free mass. [ Hu F. Measurements of Adiposity and Body Composition. In: Hu F, ed. Obesity
Epidemiology. New York City: Oxford University Press, 2008; 53–83.]

3.4 Leptin

Serum leptin levels positively correlates with obesity.
• Increases insulin sensitivity
• Decreases hepatic production of glucose contributing to glucose lowering effects.

3.5	Other adipokines adiponectin, adipsin

3.5.1 Adiponectin

• Plays an important role in development of IR. Also, adiponectin levels are reduced in
association with IR
• Enhance insulin sensitivity through increased fatty acid secretion and inhibition of hepatic
glucose production.

3.5.2 Adipsin

• Improves beta cell function
• Serum adipsin level negatively correlated with IR

3.6 GLP-1

Active GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion and suppresses glucagon secretion thereby achieving a
better glycemic control.

4.	Goal

Our goal is to analyse and infer whether adding the above factors/ predictors make the model
more accurate.

5.	Supporting mathematical equations

The minimal model of insulin glusose pathway is extended to include the role of adipocytes and
insulin response.

Figure 1: Incretins and glycemic control
where G(t), I(t) denotes blood glucose concentration and blood insulin concentration at time t,
respectively. There x(t) is an auxiliary function to model the time delay in insulin-dependent
glucose uptake activity. G(0) = b0, x(0) = 0, I(0) = b7 + Ib, (G − b5)+ = (G − b5), if G > b5, 0
otherwise. Gb is the baseline glycemia and Ib is baseline insulemia of the subject; b1, . . . , b6 are
various rate constants, and b0, b7 are constants.
In eqn 1 there are two additional terms Cl and Ca representing the action of leptin and
adiponectin in lowering blood glucose level by reducing hepatic glucose production. In egn 3 the
term Cd corresponds to increase in concentration of insulin as adipsin enhances beta cell function.
kGLP is the rate constant for concentration of active GLP1. Eqn 4 represents the rate of change
of active GLP-1. It is directly correlated to DPP-4 inhibitors(if any intake). Also active GLP-1
depends on the amount of glucose intake.
