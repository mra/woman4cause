I am a research scholar in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur. I am a vivid learner and I hope to use my knowledge in finding new methods and techniques that would help computational bioscientists. I have a BTech in Computer Science and have worked in embedded systems domain for two years. I also have experience in research projects under SRIC, IIT Kharagpur.
My current focus is on "computational modelling of biophysical systems" specifically insulin-glucose model. The work is based on ordinary differential equations where the physical system and substrates involved are represented using concentration equations. These mathematically modelled equations are later estimated for unknown parameters in the system. The parameters are analysed for sensitivity and other metrics. The conclusion maybe a physiological significance of the parameters derived from the model.</p>
