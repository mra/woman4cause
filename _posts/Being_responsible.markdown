**Personal responsibility**
<p style="text-align:justify">
I take full responsibility for my actions and choices, and I believe in acknowledging the influence of various factors, including my upbringing and the role of my parents. While I understand that my parents have played a significant role in shaping my life, it would be unfair and unproductive to place blame solely on them for any challenges or shortcomings I may face. Instead, I prefer to focus on personal growth, learning from my experiences, and taking ownership of my own decisions and their consequences. I am enough to choose good for me.
