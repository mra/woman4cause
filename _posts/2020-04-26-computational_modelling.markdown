**Kidney-on-a-chip**
<p style="text-align:justify">The kidney is one of the most complicated organs in the human body. It, therefore,
presents an enormous challenge for researchers to develop a platform of “kidney-on-
a-chip” that can mimic its function when exposed to various drugs and medications.</centre></p>

<p style="text-align:justify">An on-chip nephron device made out of a single multilayered polymer construct
has been proposed by Weinberg et al. The chip resembles the functioning
nephron with three sections, viz. the glomerulus, the proximal tubule and the loop
of Henle and is made up of two microfabricated layers separated by a membrane.
The filtration of the glomerular unit, the reabsorption in the tubule, and the large
increase in urea concentration in the loop of Henle were all observed when a blood
sample was introduced into the on-chip nephron device. This was one of the first
attempts in the field. Though it was a successful attempt, there were challenges to
be addressed related to the culture and control of the various cell types and the
filtration process for the separation of waste was not as efficient as for the normal
nephron.</p>



**Human breathing-lung-on-a-chip**
<p style="text-align:justify">The lung-on-a-chip is a complex, three-dimensional model of a living, breathing
human lung on a microchip. The device is made using human lung and blood
vessel cells and it can predict absorption of airborne nanoparticles and mimic the
inflammatory response triggered by microbial pathogens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">Currently two research groups have come up with lung-on-chip. The alveolus
lung-chip emulates fundamental lung functions of the alveolus, such as gas exchange
and absorption. It has been used in a range of applications, including evaluation of
nanoparticle absorption and toxicity, study of disease development and assessment
of adverse drug effects, such as pulmonary edema and pulmonary thrombosis. The
airway lung-chip (AwLC) recapitulates the physiology and function of the airway
epithelium, which conducts inhaled air to the alveolar air sacs.</p>

**Pancreas-on-a-chip**

<p style="text-align:justify"> The design of the islet-on-a-chip was inspired by the human pancreas, in which
islands of cells (“islets”) receive a continuous stream of information about glucose
levels from the bloodstream and adjust their insulin production as needed.
Before transplanting beta cells into a patient, they must be tested to see whether
they are functioning properly. The current method for doing this is based on
technology from the 1970s: giving the cells glucose to elicit an insulin response,
collecting samples, adding reagents and taking measurements to see how much
insulin is present in each one. The manual process being highly time consuming
to run and interpret may cause clinicians to not pursue it. The new, automated,
miniature device gives results in real time enables speeding up clinical decision
making.</p>

**Foetal membranes-on-a-chip**
<p style="text-align:justify">Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of premature death in new-borns and
children under the age of five. While the causes and the process triggering PTB
are still not understood, 70% of the PTB cases have been correlated with bacterial
infection of the foetal membrane, so called “chorioamnionitis” (CAM). CAM
does not lead to premature rupture of the foetal membranes (PPROM) and this is
possibly due to the innate maternal and foetal response. In order to clarify the
origin of PPROM and the spatio-temporal progress of CAM a new human model
of the foetal membranes are developed where bacterial infection and propagation
through the foetal membrane can be observed and studied.</p>
